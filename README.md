# Plan Rutgers Fall 2015

## Aesthetically Pleasing
Well designed UI/UX to make entering your courses and sections easy and efficient. Presents a beautiful, printable, calendar that's easy to read and readily available in case you forget any course information.

## Intelligent Confirmation
Communicates with Python backend and the official Rutgers' Schedule of Classes to make sure all your classes entered are valid and do not conflict with each other, while also accounting for travel times between classes as set by Rutgers' WebReg.

## Future Addons
* Support for comparing multiple schedules so you can see the intersection of free time between classes for each person.
* Customized bus scheduling that communicates with the NextBus and Google Maps API to implement an efficient routing system designed to predict bus arrival times based on given schedule, along with giving information as to the location of each building.

## Furthur Information
The app is currently in beta testing stage and can be reached at [planrutgers.com](planrutgers.com).

Currently hosted on Heroku as a single-dyno app so it may take a few moments to load during low traffice interims.
